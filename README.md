# Welcome to the repository of my Week-14A projects!

On Week 14A we have to deal with 2 C#-related topics:
* collections
* file- and directory-handling

Most of the code has been given as a sample,
we only have to re-type them.

[Description can be found here.](Description.md)

The project-folders about collections are:
* [SequentialCollections](SequentialCollections/)
* [DictionaryCollections](DictionaryCollecgtions/)
* [LookupCollections](LookupCollections/)
* [GenericCollections](GenericCollections/)

The project-folder about files and directories is:
* [SeekAndArchive](SeekAndArchive/)

Please, see how I'm developing my work.  
Thank you!
